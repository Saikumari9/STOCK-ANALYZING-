## Stock Analyzing
This repository contains a Python script for analyzing stock data using the yfinance library and web scraping.

# Description
The "stock_analyzing.py" script is designed to analyze stock data for two companies, Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME). The script retrieves historical share price data for the selected companies using the yfinance library. It also scrapes quarterly revenue data from the Macrotrends website using web scraping techniques.

The script then visualizes the historical share price and revenue data using the Plotly library. It generates separate graphs for Tesla and GameStop, displaying the trends in share prices and revenues over time.

pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
requests: A library for making HTTP requests to retrieve web page content.
